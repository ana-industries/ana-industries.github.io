# Who We Are

ANA is started by a frustrated reliability engineer who never found a working software that solve asset management problem in his years of professional life. He works on the ground with software blind to the real problem at hands. To solve them, he needs a bottom up solution.

Then, the engineer approach a programmer to pitch the idea. They talked at length of what exactly are the problems and how a software can helps. Some prototypes are made but those are pretty off the mark.

Finally, the programmer invited a designer into the team. With a heavy user on the ground, a programmer and a UX designer, ANA the team is formed.

ANA, both the team and the software, is a tiny little fish in a big pond. There are a lot of big players in the field of asset management, each solving different problems. Ironically, they mostly solve it the wrong way, or in a complicated way. So complicated that no one enjoy working with these software. ANA takes a different, and yet modern, approach to the game.

We are here to make asset managers happy and healthy. We improve their quality of work life so much that they no longer hate the software in their work.

Happy user, quality data.

There comes our second focus: gather real, useful, on the ground data. There are a lot of talks about big data, data science, data driven, what-not. Not enough attention paid to gathering good data. ANA is here to fix that.

# Who You Are

None of us here enjoy micromanaging (or been micromanaged). So you better enjoy being a Manager of One.

# What's it likes to work here

ANA is a 100% remote team. The engineer is working in Australia. The programmer at Malaysia. The designer at USA.

We work asynchronously with Basecamp. Most communication is done with long, written post, like an email but in a more manageable way. Replies and comments are expected to come in 1 or 2 days late. Real time chat happens occasionally but usually about casual stuff. We do video call very rarely, it usually happens during end of a development cycle. Or when something big is coming up and we need a face to face sync up.

Basically, we leave you alone with your work and life. You choose your own time to work and check-in with the team (reply message, ask question, tick off to-do). There is no way for anyone to see who is working (green dot) or who is not (yellow dot). We believe when one's life is straighten up, the next thing to want is doing good work.

We follow ShapeUp in our development works. We may do longer or shorter cycle. We usually stick with the idea of shaping up a broad-stroked idea, hand it out to the team to work out the details by themselves, wrap up before the time is up. You will have
