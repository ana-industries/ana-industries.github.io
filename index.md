# Work in ANA

## Who We Are

A team of two engineers and one designer with a mission to gather real asset management data and make it easily accessible and useful. We are here to make life easier for asset managers with a little help from our product.

ANA's story began in early 2019 when a reliability engineer, who is tired of working with mediocre bloated asset management software, wants to solve the real problems faced by the people working in the frontline. The enemy of asset management is poor quality data. A mistake in data could potentially cost the loss of many lives. This problem attracted a software engineer who enjoys a good challenge and a curious designer to ANA.

In ANA, we believe that we don't need a huge team or a lengthy development cycle to build great software. Our approach is to stay small, agile and deliver only what users need and get rid of anything they don’t. There are a lot of big players in the field of asset management, each solving different problems. However, the legacy software platforms are usually a combination of slow, overly complicated for users, and overly simplified by design without consideration of data collection, and ultimately data analytics. The old lengthy, top-down hierarchical bureaucratic processes that cause the bloat up are slowly getting nudged out of the picture.

Our product focuses on gathering real, useful, on the ground data. There are a lot of talks about big data, data science, data-driven and what-not but very few pay attention to gathering good, quality data. ANA is here to fix that.

## Who You Are

You are a friendly, eager learner, and supportive person. Because we are!

You do not enjoy being micro-managed. You prefer to work at your own pace and chart your own path towards the goal. If you enjoy being a [Manager of One](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one), you'll like it here.

You embrace failures, own and others'. You prefer to tinker out a [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) solution by doing and failing, not following a 10 pages design document. In ANA, we start real works with a single page pitching document with hand-drawn sketches.

## What it is like to work here

ANA is a 100% remote team. The engineer is working in Australia. The programmer in Malaysia. The designer in the USA.

We work asynchronously with [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com). Most communication is done with long, written posts, like an email but in a more manageable way. Replies and comments are expected to come in 1 or 2 days late. Real-time chat happens occasionally but usually about casual stuff. We do video calls very rarely, it usually happens at the end of a development cycle. Or when something big is coming up and we need a face to face sync up.

We leave you alone with your work and life. You choose your own time to work and check in with the team (reply message, ask questions, tick off to-do). There is no way for anyone to see who is working (green dot) or who is not (yellow dot). We believe when one's life straightens up, the next thing to want is doing good work.

We follow [ShapeUp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) in our development works. We may do longer or shorter cycles. We usually stick with the idea of shaping up a broad-stroked idea, hand it out to the team to work out the details by themselves, wrap up before the time is up.
